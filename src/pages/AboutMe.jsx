      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a multidisciplinary creative and full-stack web developer who thrives at the intersection of design, code, and storytelling. With a background in visual arts, writing, and the human element, I approach each project balancing technical execution and artistic insight to create an engaging product.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        As a developer, I specialize in building user-centered applications from front to back. Using modern tools and frameworks to bring ideas to life in responsive, scalable, and elegant ways. Whether I'm designing interfaces or architecting full systems, I do so with both creativity and clarity.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        Beyond the technical, I am a people-first collaborator who values communication, empathy, and individual growth. In leadership roles, I cultivate fulfilling environments where every contributor feels heard and positively engaged. I believe the best work and healthiest workforce emerges when people feel that their accomplishments are celebrated, their small changes are complemented, and their grievances both listened to and handled.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        Curious, adaptable, and driven by connection, I see every project as an opportunity to fuse disciplines, elevate ideas, and build something meaningful - together.
